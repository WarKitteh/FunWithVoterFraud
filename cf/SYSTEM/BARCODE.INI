/*

Each field is comma delimited.
If a field is not present all following fields will keep the predefined (hard-coded) default.

Field 	Description
0	Error correction level - default is 5.

1	Row limit. This is the number of rows per bar symbol. Maximum is 90 and good
	compromise of readability and size is 45. 90 is default which is likely too large for
	some readers.

2	This 3 byte field is the ascii representation of the value passed into InitBarScale().
	The bar coding function uses this to calculate how many data region columns it can build
	safely without exceeding the printable width of the printer. This value is for the 
	width of the normalized (1:1) bar symbol. 284 is the ideal value for the CP305MRS 
	printer made by APS. The calculation below shows why:

	Printer width (in dots) = 576
	Image scaled by printer = x2
	1:1 image width is 576/2 = 288
	With 2 quiet zones at 2x each we have 288-4 = 284

3	Image height multiplier. This is the number of times a normalized row is printed to
	increase the height (and therefore readability) of the symbol.
		

4	This parameter controls CP305MRS print speed. Valid values are between 1501 and 8499.
	Formula for calculating print speed is:
	(1/(8*value e-6)) = mm/sec
	where value = 5000 gives 25mm/sec
	Factory default is 2500 which gives 50mm/sec.

5	This is the lines per page allowed to be printed on a voter receipt before asking the voter
	to view the paper record.

6	This is the number of inches to scroll the paper after a receipt is printed.
	The default is 12.
